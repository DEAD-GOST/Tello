# Tello
> Created By: `Karan Singh`.
####  Librabry to controll Dji Tello
As there was no library available to control the Tello DJI drone by nodemcu or by Arduino, there was only 1 library founded, but even that was not working, so i have created a library from the scratch.


## Usage
This library includes a class "Tello"
- First, make an object of the class Tello
    ```sh
    Tello tello;
    ```
- Then you call init function to initialize it. In setup loop
    ```sh
    void setup(){
        .....
        tello.init();
    }
    ```
-  Then for take-off simply call takeoff
    ```sh
    tello.takeoff();
    ```
- And for landing 
    ```sh
    tello.land();
    ```
And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

## Installation
##### Download, This library either by zip or by git.
##### Then add the tello file in Arduino library, located in Document -> Arduino -> Library.
